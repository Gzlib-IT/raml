## Introduction

Repository of raml traits and resource type files. This repo contains traits and resource types that can be re-used by other projects to limit duplicated.

Trait examples:

 - Authorization
 - Language
 - Pagination
 - etc...
 
Resource types:

 - Get, Post, Delete, Put, File upload, etc.. options.
 
This is the master location for the traits and resource types, while each module is the master for its own schemas, examples, and actual RAML files.
